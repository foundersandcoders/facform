Week 8 project for FAC5 to create a learning platform for Founders & Coders.

## Production
For ease of use, this production section will be at the top of the README until end of the initial sprint on Friday. This production section contains a section on rules to help us work better, production standards, as well as production resources and a production log.
#### Repo Owner
Technically: everyone. However the person responsible for any issues with the Repo (merge conflicts, broken branches, bad dependencies, etc) is [Jack M](https://github.com/jackpandas). In order to be able to help, Jack will be doing his best to keep up to date with all pull requests to the Master branch, so please let him know if/when your team has code to contribute.
#### Rules
+ Anyone pushing to the master branch from their local computer has to buy a round of drinks for everyone on friday.
+ Anyone merging their own pull request to the master branch has to buy a round of drinks for everyone on friday.  

#### Resources

Pivotal Tracker: Project tracking located [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1376992)

Project Wireframes: Located at [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cWb6hFbg6THoIsz7FQiDJXwGlKGLkmeXTYfaZad_bc4/edit?pli=1#slide=id.ga28673939_0_1)

More to come... 

#### Production Standards  

**Branches, Commits and Pull Requests**

+ Please work on branches with relevant and specific names, for the sake of others.
+ Please include specific file changes in your commit messages. Better "test/tests.html updated" than "Tests updated".
+ Please include the URL link to your pivotal tracker story in the comments for any pull request to the master branch.
+ Please take one minute to make your pull request comments as detailed as possible for people who are working on completely different sections of the site.

**Code Coverage**

+ Master Branch minimum code coverage: 100%

**Testing**

+ You are responsible for writing tests for your own code. If you want to contribute to the master branch, please ensure that you have relevant tests in place.

**Code Style**

+ For the sake of consistency, please use double-space linting on code. You can also use [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) if you are feeling lazy.
+ Check your code with [JS Lint](http://jslint.com/)
+ Please use [JSDoc](https://github.com/docdis/learn-jsdoc) to comment your code.
+ Please order CSS alphabetically.
